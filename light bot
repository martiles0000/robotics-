What lightbot can teach you is coding and programming. I learned that we have to plan what steps we take before we actually
go forward, like with the robot we kinda have to think ahead so we have enough space to put the movemets 
and as we get to other levels it gets harder to figure out the steps, so it reminds me of how diffucult robotics might be.
